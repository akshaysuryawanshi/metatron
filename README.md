# Metatron

Metatron is a Ruby library for creating [Metacontroller](https://metacontroller.github.io/metacontroller/)-based custom Kubernetes controllers.

The intention is to make it as easy as possible to use Ruby to manage [custom resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/) within your Kubernetes infrastructure. No Golang required!

For more information, see the [Metatron Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/jgnagy/metatron/wiki)!

For help on how to get started, take a look at the [User Guide](https://github.com/jgnagy/metatron/wiki/User-Guide) in the Wiki!
